# DH_comparisons
 ***This is a lab notebook from DSCI 326 lab 1.1.***
 
 This notebook is about data wrangling of baseball statistics in `polars`.
 League ERA and slugging percentage (SLG) were compared between two leagues (American League and National League) before and after the DH rule (Designated Hitter) had been introduced.
